            <h2>A Brief History About Ghana</h2>
            <p>
                Ghana became the first sub-Saharan African nation to gain independence from colonial rule on March 6, 1957,punder the leadership of Kwame Nkrumah, a key figure in the Pan-African movement.
                Nkrumah became Ghana's first president and sought to modernize the country through ambitious development projects,though his government was overthrown in 1966.
                Ghana experienced a series of military coups over the following decades.
                Stability was restored in the 1990s, and Ghana has since developed a reputation for its democratic governance and economic progress.
                Today, Ghana is known for its rich cultural heritage, vibrant democracy, and as a major producer of cocoa and gold.

            <h2>A Brief History About Education in Ghana</h2>
            <p>
                Post-independence reforms sought to improve educational quality and access, 
                though challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, teacher shortages, 
                and regional disparities persisted. In the 1980s and 1990s, economic difficulties
                 led to a decline in educational quality, but reforms in the late 1990s, 
                 such as the Free Compulsory Universal Basic Education (FCUBE) program, aimed to revitalize the sector.
                 Today, Ghanaâ€™s education system includes primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, 
                 with significant progress in access to education, especially with the 
                 introduction of the Free Senior High School policy in 2017. Despite these improvements, 
                 challenges such as disparities in rural education, teacher quality, and funding remain.
